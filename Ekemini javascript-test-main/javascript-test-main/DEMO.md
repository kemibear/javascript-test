### 🎯 Learning Objectives Covered

**Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types**
- Variable declarations (let, const, var)
- Data types (string, number, boolean, object)
- Basic operations and string manipulation

**Exercise 2: Functions**
- Function declarations and expressions
- Arrow functions and syntax variations
- Parameters, default values, and return statements
- Closures and higher-order functions
- Callback functions

**Exercise 5: Arrays**
- Array creation and manipulation
- Array methods (push, pop, filter, map, reduce)
- Finding elements and calculating values
- Immutable operations

## How It Works

### For Students

1. **Start an Exercise**
   ```bash
   cd exercises/01-variables
   # Read README.md for instructions
   # Edit exercise.js to complete functions
   ```

2. **Test Your Work**
   ```bash
   node test.js
   ```

3. **See Results**
   - ✅ Green = Success, move to next exercise
   - ❌ Red = Fix errors and try again

### For Instructors

1. **Run All Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Check Individual Exercise**
   ```bash
   npm run test:exercise 01-variables
   ```

3. **Review Solutions**
   - Each exercise has a complete `solution.js` file
   - Multiple approaches shown for teaching

## Sample Test Output

### Before Completion (Expected)
```
Testing Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
==================================================
❌ Task 1: createPersonInfo()
   Error: Should return an object
❌ Task 2: calculateAge()
   Error: calculateAge(1990) should return 34
...
Passed: 0/6
⚠️  6 test(s) failed. Keep working on it!
```

### After Completion
```
Testing Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
==================================================
✅ Task 1: createPersonInfo()
✅ Task 2: calculateAge()
✅ Task 3: formatFullName()
✅ Task 4: checkAdult()
✅ Task 5: convertTemperature()
✅ Task 6: createGreeting()

Passed: 6/6
🎉 All tests passed! Great work!
```
